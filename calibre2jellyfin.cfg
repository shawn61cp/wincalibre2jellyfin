# Multiple libraries may be created.  Each target library together with
# source and destination locations, and control options, is specified
# by a "ConstructN" section.

# Sections must be uniquely named.  Construct sections appearing after
# the first one must be numbered (e.g. [Construct2], [Construct3], ...) or
# otherwise distinguished from all other similar sections.  However
# they are distinguised, the first nine letters of the section must
# be exactly "Construct".
