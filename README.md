# wincalibre2jellyfin
Python script to construct a Jellyfin ebook library from a Calibre library.

## Windows 
<em>(The Linux version is maintained as a separate project.  Please see [calibre2jellyfin](https://github.com/shawn61cp/calibre2jellyfin).</em>

#### Overview
* Created folder structure (foldermode in .cfg) is one of:
  * .../author/series/book/...
  * .../book/...
* Destination book folder contains
  * symlink to book file in Calibre library
  * symlink to cover image in Calibre library
  * copy, possibly modified, of Calibre's metadata file
* Books are selected for inclusion by listing author folders in the .cfg file
* Series handling
  * When foldermode is author/series/book, the script will extract series and series index from Calibre's metadata file.  If found, the target book folder name will be prepended with the series index.  So will the \<dc:title\> element in the metadata file.  If series info is expected but not found, the structure collapses to .../author/book/....
* Multiple output libraries may be configured 

#### Example author/series/book structure 
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Calibre store</th><th>Created Jellyfin store</th></tr>
  </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><pre>
└── Author/
    └── Book A/
    │   ├── cover.jpg
    │   ├── metadata.opf
    │   └── Book A.epub
    ├── Book B/
    │   ├── cover.jpg
    │   ├── metadata.opf
    │   └── Book B.epub
   </pre>
   </td>
   <td><pre>
└── Author/
    └── Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Series/
        ├── 001 - Book A/
        │   ├── cover.jpg      <- symlink
        │   ├── metadata.opf   <- modified copy
        │   └── Book A.epub    <- symlink
        ├── 002 - Book B/
        │   ├── cover.jpg      <- symlink
        │   ├── metadata.opf   <- modified copy
        │   └── Book B.epub    <- symlink
   </pre>    
   </td>

Jellyfin will display a drillable folder structure similarly to the way it does for movies, shows, and music.  Jellyfin will extract and display the mangled book title that is prepended with the series index as the book title.

#### Calibre Author Folders

Typically the Calibre author folder is named exactly as the author appears in the Calibre interface.  Occasionally however it is not.  I have seen this when Calibre displays authors as "Jane Doe & John Q. Public" but the folder name is actually just "Jane Doe".  Also when the list of authors is very long, as happens in technical books, Calibre will limit the length of the folder name.

If you find that an expected author does not show up in the created Jellyfin library, double check that the author as listed in the .cfg file matches the actual folder name in the Calibre library.

Another thing I have encountered is when multiple versions of the author name exist, such as "Public, John Q." and "John Q. Public", and they are then consolidated, Calibre actually moves the books into the folder matching the consolidated name.  If the author name configured for calibre2jellyfin happened to match the author name that "went away", updates to that author's books may appear to die, or you might see two different versions of the same author in Jellyfin.  The solution is to just delete, in Jellyfin, one or both authors, ensure that the author configured in the .cfg file matches the Calibre author folder, then re-run the script to have them cleanly re-created.  Jellyfin will eventually detect the changes and update the display contents.  You can also right-click on an item within Jellyfin and request an immediate metadata refresh.  Even so sometimes it will take a few minutes  for Jellyfin to recognize the changes.
